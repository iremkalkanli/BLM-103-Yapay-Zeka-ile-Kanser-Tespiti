# Cancer Detection with Artificial Intelligence

With this algorithm, the data of a person who is not certain whether he is sick or not is fed into the system and it is tried to make an estimation of the disease. </br>
This application was carried out with kNN (k Nearest Neighborhood), an algorithm used in artificial intelligence applications.</br>
Breast Cancer data provided by UC Irvine University were used.
## Results

While doing the cancer detection project with artificial intelligence, most importantly, I learned about the kNN algorithm and selection sort algorithms.</br>
While there is a lot of information, I have been able to express and define that information in the form of a string, read and close the file, define the data in the file as a string and be able to process many other topics, and I used it actively in this project.</br>
In addition, I had the experience of thinking, working and developing a code for days or even weeks with this project.
